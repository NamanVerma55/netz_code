Appraisal Process  \\n        Ans. The Appraisal is an annual process, and each employee will be eligible for appraisal after completion \\nof one year from their date of joining or the date of their previous appraisal/compensation change.  \\na) The appraisal effective date is fixed based on the date of joining of the employee. Employees join till \\n15th day of the month – their appraisal is preponed on the 1st day of the same month next year, \\nwhereas employees joining on 16th and after – their appraisal gets shifted to the 1st day of the \\nsubsequent month in the next year. For e.g. an employee joining on 5th August 2023 – his/her appraisal \\nwill be due on 1st August 2024, where as an employee joining on 19th August 2023, his/her appraisals \\nare shifted to 1st September 2024. \\nb) The appraisals for employees are taken up on a quarterly basis and they fall due in the same quarter of \\nnext year as per the quarter when the employee joined or when his/her previous appraisal was done. \\nFor e.g. if an employee joining is on 10th February 2023, then his/her appraisal will be taken up in the \\n1st quarter of 2024 i.e. Jan-Mar 2024, and his/her appraisal after processing will be made effective from \\n1st February 2024. \\nc) If in case the joining date is after 16th Mar or 16th June or 16th Sep or 16th Dec, then in those cases their \\nquarter in which appraisal will be processed is shifted to the next quarter, since their appraisal is also \\nshifted to 1st day of the next month.  \\nd) The appraisal letters are released as and when the appraisal of the employee is confirmed, and his/her \\nincrement is approved by the Management. The effective date of appraisal is kept on the basis as \\nexplained above and the arrears, as applicable, are paid to the employee. These arrears are processed in \\nthe same month payroll if in case the appraisal/increments are approved till 25 th day of the month and \\nfor appraisal/increment approved after 25th day – their arrears are processed in next month payroll.'),\n",

What is the bonus cycle for the payouts? \\n \\nAnswer: Bonuses are paid upon the approval from the managers and tenure of bonuses \\nvaries to monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, annually depending upon the \\nappointment/appraisal letters issued to you. \\n \\n2. I have bonus components added in my appraised CTC but I didn’t get the same \\nwith my incremented salary? \\nAnswer : As per process we have to share the bonus information with all managers by \\n15th of every month as the appraisal information is provided to us later on , the impact \\nof incremented bonuses is not taken into account in the payroll of processing of \\nincremented salary with arrears. However, in the next payroll the bonuses are paid \\nalong with bonus arrears. \\nFor example : Your CTC is updated in the quarter of April to June with monthly payout \\nof PBB bonuses, we will receive the appraisal information by end of June while bonus \\ninformation is already shared with managers by 15th June, so thereby your bonus arrears \\nwill be paid in JULY payroll. \\n3. I have received less bonus amount than committed in my CTC? \\n \\nAnswer : The bonuses are paid upon approval and decision of managers. \\n \\nFor example : Your Quarterly PBB is due of Rs 60,000/- while in actual you get Rs \\n54000. So as your PBB bonus is approved 90% by manager so your actual payout \\namount is less than your actual amount due.  \\n4 . How TDS is deducted on bonus amount? \\nAnswer : One-time TDS deduction is done in the month of salary in which bonus \\namount is paid.  \\nFor example : Rs 1,00,000 is paid in July salary and you are falling in 20% tax bracket, \\nso Rs 20800 gets deducted as TDS i.e. ( 20% Income tax+4% education cess) \\nRs 1,00,000 is paid in July salary and you are falling in 30% tax bracket, so Rs 31200 \\ngets deducted as TDS i.e. ( 30% Income tax+4% education cess)'),\n",

The document provides information on how employer EPF part is shown under EPF passbook, and mentions that the amount you can withdraw in cash form is the employee PF contribution and the employer part contribution.

      "\n",
      "Answer: You can opt for a higher EPF deduction by submitting a request to your employer. The amount of EPF deduction is determined by the employer's contribution, which is 12% of the basic salary. However, if you want to contribute more than the mandatory 12%, you can submit a request to your employer to increase the EPF deduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, let's say your basic salary is Rs 1,00,000 and the employer's contribution is 12% of that amount, which is Rs 12,000 (12% of Rs 1,00,000). If you want to contribute an additional Rs 5,000 towards EPF, your total EPF deduction would be Rs 17,000 (Rs 12,000 + Rs 5,000).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if you want to go for a higher EPF deduction than the mandatory 12%, you can submit a request to your employer stating the amount you want to contribute. Your employer will then adjust the EPF deduction accordingly in your salary.\n",
